Building a dynamic dashboard for a coffee franchise: excel case study

Objective 1: Prepare the data for analysis
1. Take a moment to familiarize with the data. How many transactions were recorded, over what period of time? What products and product categories were sold?
2. Add a new column to calculate Revenue 
3. Add new columns to calculate Month and Day of Week based on the transaction date
4. Add a new column to extract Hour from the transaction time

Objective 2: Explore the data with pivot tables
1. Insert a pivot table on a new tab to show revenue by month
2. Add two more pivot table (on the same sheet) to show the number of transactions by day of week and by hour of day
3. Add a pivot table (on the same sheet) to show the number of transactions by product category, sorted descending by transactions
4. Add a pivot table (on the same sheet) to show the number of transactions and revenue by product type, sorted descending and filtered to the Top 15 (by transactions)

Objective 3: Building a dynamic dashboard
1. Add pivot charts to show revenue bu month as a line chart, transactions by day of week and hour of day as column charts, and transaction by product category as a bar chart
2. Assemble the charts into a rough dashboard layout, and include space for the pivot table showing top 15 product types
3. Add a slicer for store location, and connect it to all of the pivot tables on the sheet
